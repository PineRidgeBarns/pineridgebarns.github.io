        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Pine Ridge Barns, Inc. opened its doors in 2000 by Ed Timmons Sr. He and his family lived in this are for
        more than 100 years. It was the familyâ€™s intent to offer high quality storage sheds, gazebos, and outdoor
        furniture to family, friends, neighbors, and new comers to our home on the Delmarva Peninsula. Our search led us
        to Lancaster County PA where we partnered with the Amish craftsman of that area. This has been a huge success,
        as we not only have the highest quality products available, but we have created strong business and personal
        relationships with a group of honest, hard working people. The Timmons Family business has grown tremendously
        and now offers a great selection of our products online that further promotes the craftsmanship of the Amish
        community. All of our products online are now shipped worldwide. We thank you for visiting our web site and hope
        that you will receive many years of enjoyment from the products you purchase.</p>

        <h2>Delivery Information</h2>

        <h3>Sheds</h3>
        <p>Our sheds are built by the Amish in Lancaster County, PA. They are trucked to our area via tractor-trailers, and
        then delivered locally by our delivery vehicles. We service an 80-mile radius from our business in Millsboro, DE
        19966. Due to the size, weight, and bulk of these sheds it makes in financially infeasible to ship these
        products out of this area.</p>
